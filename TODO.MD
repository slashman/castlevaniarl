Visuals
- Dash animation should show the enemy on every tile it's dashing at least

Gameplay
- Walking into a wall or trying to use a power you can't afford still takes a turn.
- Improve Jump: is there any reason not to jump literally every move?
  - Add cooldown to jump
  - Make it only useful in battle or moving around
  - When not in combat, should be the same as moving

User Interface
- Cannot move cursors with WASD pad when targetting for instance
- The range where you can move the cursor in the 'f' fire mode doesn't respect your weapon's max range.
- S to go down is weird even if WASD makes sense. But diagonals are used a lot in the game. 
  - Consider WADX instead.
- . to attack is awkward when using arrow keys, and might be hard to find, easy to miss with , too

Audio
- Boss battle midi gets bugged on loop

Manual:
- Explain the mechanics and powers in the manual.
- Explain jump adequately.
